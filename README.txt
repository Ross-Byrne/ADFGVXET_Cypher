This is my take on the ADFGVX Cypher. Instead it is the "ADFGVXET Cypher". 
Two extra letters where added to include spacesand other special characters.

 *** My testing ***

Encrypting War And Peace by Leo Tolstoy takes about 0.3 seconds.

Decrypting War And Peace by Leo Tolstoy takes about 0.6 seconds. 
(Sometimes Decrypting takes 1 second, other times it takes 0.4 seconds).

Used the keyword "helloworld".

Program starts taking longer if smaller keywords are used.
